Looking at the results of the timers for the functions it is noted that as the array size increases the functions take
longer amounts of time, yet the insert function, which unshifts an array seems to become exponentially longer to execute as the array size increases. It is interesting to see 
how the insert function is faster in the tiny and medium array when compared to the append but the small array appends 
faster. I'm chalking the reasoning for that up to my CPU. the better function to use for time efficiency is the append 
function. The insert function is slower because it has to reassign each item a new index and add the new item at the very beginning.
